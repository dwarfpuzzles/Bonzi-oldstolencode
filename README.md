# bonzi.world framework remake

Now in Extended Support Release by dwarfpuzzles.


This bonziworld respository is a remake of the bonzi.world framework, (a really bad one) which was used for BonziWORLD Revived.
Feel free to use this as your own bonziworld server

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Seamusmario/BonziWORLD-Revived
cd BonziWORLD
```
Or, if you already have a folder named BonziWORLD, then do this.
```
git clone https://github.com/Seamusmario/bonzi.world-framework-remake/ bw2

### Client
This part is unneeded. An pre-built version is available.
```
### Server
```
cd bwr-server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
